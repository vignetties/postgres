To check is whether autovacuum has processed them or not:

SELECT schemaname, relname, n_live_tup, n_dead_tup, last_autovacuum
FROM pg_stat_all_tables
ORDER BY n_dead_tup
    / (n_live_tup
       * current_setting('autovacuum_vacuum_scale_factor')::float8
          + current_setting('autovacuum_vacuum_threshold')::float8)
     DESC
LIMIT 10;


SELECT schemaname, relname, n_live_tup, n_dead_tup, last_autovacuum
FROM pg_stat_user_tables
ORDER BY n_dead_tup
    / (n_live_tup
       * current_setting('autovacuum_vacuum_scale_factor')::float8
          + current_setting('autovacuum_vacuum_threshold')::float8)
     DESC
LIMIT 10;

How to monitor autovacuum has processed bloated tables ?
If you are suspecting bloated tables in your PostgreSQL infrastructure, 
The  first thing to check is vacuum has processed those bloated table. 
We use following script to collect last processed vacuum data:

SELECT schemaname, relname, n_live_tup, n_dead_tup, last_autovacuum
FROM pg_stat_all_tables
ORDER BY n_dead_tup
    / (n_live_tup
       * current_setting('autovacuum_vacuum_scale_factor')::float8
          + current_setting('autovacuum_vacuum_threshold')::float8)
     DESC
LIMIT 10;


For the general settings use:

select *
from pg_settings 
where name like '%autovacuum%'

If you want to see the vacuum settings for a specific table:

SELECT relname, reloptions FROM pg_class WHERE relname='tablename';


https://www.datadoghq.com/blog/postgresql-vacuum-monitoring/


By default, autovacuuming should already be turned on, but letâ€™s double check:

SELECT name, setting FROM pg_settings WHERE name='autovacuum';


We can query pg_class to check if autovacuum is enabled on this table:

SELECT reloptions FROM pg_class WHERE relname='my_table';


to run last vaccum run and last auto vaccum run.

SELECT relname, last_vacuum, last_autovacuum FROM pg_stat_user_tables;

TO on and off auto vacuum:

Edit the postgresql.conf and change
#autovacuum = on
to
autovacuum = off

and save it.

Then
psql -U postgres -c "SELECT pg_reload_conf();"

No need to restart postgres.
